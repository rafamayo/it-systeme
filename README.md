# it-systeme

As part of the course "IT systems" (*IT-Systeme*), at the Kempten University of Applied Sciences (Hochschule Kempten https://www.hs-kempten.de/) we introduce a simple 8-Bit CPU to explore the workings of a universal programmable computer using the Von Neumann architecture.

This repository includes a simple two-pass assembler for the CPU's architecture and a CPU emulator.
